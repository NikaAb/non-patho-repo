### Investigate the baseline immune repertoire diversity in “healthy” humans


Numerous studies highlight the correlation between the immune repertoire diversity and one individual’s immune states (healthy, infection, autoimmune disease, etc.)[REF]. These studies use healthy or non-pathological repertoires as a control to represent the physiological diversity, from which any deviation can potentially be associated with one pathology [REF]. The accuracy of identifying the immune repertoire baseline diversity can significantly impact the reliability and interpretability of all the downstream analyses that provide valuable insights for diagnostic[REF], therapeutic[REF], and clinical indications[REF].


In an attempt to further investigate the baseline immune repertoire diversity in “healthy” humans, we would like to organize a study including the following steps :

1- Finding the “healthy” repertoire sequences. These repertoires can be qualified as “healthy”, “unperturbed”, or “non-pathological” [add other terms] in the literature. It is essential to establish different categories of data based on age, sampling tissue, sampling depth, the cluster of differentiation markers, etc.

2- Analyzing each of the selected repertoires with various IMGT tools (IMGT/HighV-QUEST, add other relevant tools)

3- Characterizing the collection of selected repertoires with ImmuneRef, a multi-feature measure of immune repertoire similarity.

4- Selecting the most informative features of repertoire diversity for characterizing a repertoire with physiological diversity (as opposed to pathological diversity)
